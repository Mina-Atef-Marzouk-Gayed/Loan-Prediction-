## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a **comparative study** of six machine learning algorithms applied to loan eligibility prediction using two real-world datasets.  

The models tested include:  
- Logistic Regression (LR)  
- Decision Tree (DT)  
- Random Forest (RF)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes (NB)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

Random Forest consistently achieved the **highest performance** across both datasets, demonstrating its reliability and stability for **automated loan approval systems**.
