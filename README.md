This project compares six machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM—for loan eligibility prediction on two financial datasets. After thorough preprocessing, Random Forest emerged as the most accurate and reliable, highlighting ML’s role in fair, fast, and automated loan approvals.
